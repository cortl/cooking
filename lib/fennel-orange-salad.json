  "notes": [
    "Slice all the ingredients a day ahead. Store the citrus in one airtight container, and the shallot and fennel in another. Keep refrigerated. You can also make the dressing a day ahead and refrigerate it in a tightly covered mason jar. When youâ€™re ready to serve the salad, all that is left to do is quickly assemble and dress it."
