        "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
        "1 large onion - finely chopped",
        "2 cloves garlic - minced",
        "1- inch piece of ginger - minced",

  "instructions": [
    "Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they are soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.",
    "Add the diced carrots and potatoes to the pan. Stir and cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the vegetables to start softening.",
    "Sprinkle the curry powder, garam masala, and flour over the vegetables. Stir well to coat the vegetables in the spices and flour, and cook for 1-2 minutes to let the spices bloom and the flour cook slightly.",
    "Gradually add the broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Once all the broth is added, bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and honey (or sugar). Stir well to combine.",
    "Let the curry sauce simmer gently for 15-20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender and the sauce has thickened to your liking. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.",
    "Add the frozen peas to the sauce and cook for another 5 minutes until they are heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Serve the curry sauce over a bed of rice with a crispy katsu cutlet on top."
