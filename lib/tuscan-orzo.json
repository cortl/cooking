        "1 Tbsp olive oil",

        "1 tsp Italian seasoning",
        "1 14.5oz. can roasted petite diced tomatoes",
        "1 tsp lemon juice",
        "1 tsp Dijon mustard",

        "1 1/2 cups vegetable broth",

  "instructions": [
    "Add the oil, butter, and onion to a pot over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion for 3-4 minutes.",
    "Add the garlic, Italian seasoning, canned tomatoes, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and orzo. Stir often, cooking for 3 minutes.",
    "Add the vegetable broth and room temperature cream. Once it starts to bubble, turn the heat down to medium-low and continue cooking for 10 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally so the orzo doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot. It should steadily simmer but not boil. You don’t want all of the liquid to evaporate.",
    "Take the pot off the heat and stir in the parmesan, spinach, and parsley. Stir again and cover the pot for a few minutes until it has thickened up to your liking.",
    "Season with salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy!"
