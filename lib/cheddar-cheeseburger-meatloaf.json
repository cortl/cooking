    "Finely mince the onion. Roughly chop the cheddar cheese so that it is in pieces about the same size as a small bean.",
    "Add the ground beef, seasoned breadcrumbs, whisked egg, minced onion, and chopped cheddar to a bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until incorporated.",
    "Place the meat mixture in a casserole dish or on a rimmed baking sheet and shape into a rectangle, approximately 7\" long, 4\" wide, and 1.5\" thick. ",
