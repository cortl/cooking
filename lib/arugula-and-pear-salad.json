    "Toss the pear slices with the sugar in a medium bowl until evenly coated. Heat the butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until the foaming subsides. Add the pear slices in a single layer and cook, shaking the pan gently, until browned on the first side, about 1 minute. Carefully flip the slices with a thin flexible offset spatula and continue cooking until the second side is browned, about 1 minute longer. Slide the pears onto a large plate and allow to cool for 5 minutes",
    "Combine the pears, arugula, cheese, a pinch of salt, a few cracks of pepper, and the vinaigrette in a large bowl and gently toss with clean hands until evenly coated. Serve immediately."
