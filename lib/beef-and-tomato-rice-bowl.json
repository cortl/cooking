    "Set a deep stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat and add the cooking oil. Once the oil has warmed, add the ground beef and sprinkle it with a 1/2 teaspoon salt. Once the beef has browned, remove it from the pan and set aside. Keep about 2 tablespoons of rendered fat in the pan.",
    "Add the diced onion to the pan and cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the minced garlic to the pan and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.",

    "Add the chicken broth and drained chickpeas to the beef mixture. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and stir to combine. Cover the pan and cook until the chickpeas soften, about 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "While the beef mixture cooks, add the rice to a rice cooker, along with the water, salted butter, and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt.",
    "When the beef and tomato mixture finishes cooking, sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Divide the rice into four bowls and top with the beef mixture. Enjoy!"
