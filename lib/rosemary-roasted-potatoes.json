    "Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Wash your potatoes well, then cut them into 3/4-inch cubes or pieces.",
    "Place the potatoes in a large bowl and add the olive oil, minced garlic, dried rosemary, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 15 cranks of a pepper mill). Toss the potatoes until they are evenly coated in oil and spices.",
