        "3/4 cup (5 1/2 ounces) sugar",
        "1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda",
        "1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)",
        "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
        "1 tablespoon vanilla extract",
        "1/4 cup (3 ounces) golden syrup, such as Lyle’s, sorghum, unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap), or honey",
        "1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, solid but creamy—about 70°F",
        "2 1/2 cups (12 ounces) whole wheat flour (not stone-ground or white whole wheat), plus more for dusting"

  "instructions": [
    "Make the dough: Combine sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, vanilla, golden syrup, and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until somewhat light, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add whole wheat flour, and mix to form a soft dough.",
    "Scrape dough onto a work surface and knead gently to form a ball. Divide in half. Use immediately or wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth.",
    "Roll and bake the dough: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F. Generously flour a large sheet of parchment and place one portion of dough in the center. Pat into a 5-by-6-inch rectangle, sprinkle with flour, flip, and dust again. Working from the center out and adding more flour as needed, roll the dough until roughly 15-by-11 inches and very thin. Slide onto an aluminum baking sheet and brush away excess flour. Repeat with remaining dough.",
    "For grocery store look-alikes, score each sheet of dough into twelve 2 1/4-by-4 3/4-inch rectangles and dock with a bamboo skewer or the narrow end of a chopstick (a strictly cosmetic procedure). Otherwise, leave the dough uncut.",
    "Bake until crackers are tawny brown and firm, though your fingertip may leave a faint indentation, about 20 minutes. Immediately cut along the pre-scored lines with a knife, or cut into free-form shapes using a pizza wheel. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheets. Enjoy scrap pieces as a snack, or pulverize into crumbs. The grahams can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature or frozen for up to 3 months."

    "Would definitely bake this one less than 20 minutes, around 18 was great"
