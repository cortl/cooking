        "1 yellow onion",
        "2 cloves garlic",
        "1 tsp grated fresh ginger",
        "2 Tbsp olive oil",
        "1.5 Tbsp curry powder",
        "1 tsp cumin",
        "2 15oz. cans chickpeas, drained",
        "1 8oz. can tomato sauce",
        "1 13.5oz. can full-fat coconut milk",
        "4 oz. chopped kale (about 3 cups)"
      ]
    }

  "instructions": [
    "Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger to a large deep skillet along with the olive oil. Sauté the aromatics over medium-low heat for about five minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent.",
    "Add the curry powder and cumin to the skillet and continue to stir and cook for about one minute more to toast the spices.",
    "Drain the chickpeas, then add them to the skillet along with the tomato sauce and coconut milk. Stir everything to combine.",
    "Turn the heat up to medium-high to bring the sauce up to a simmer. Once simmering, turn the heat back down to medium-low and allow the curry to continue to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Add the kale and stir it into the sauce. Continue to cook and stir until the kale has wilted to your desired tenderness (I cook for about 5 minutes more). Finally, taste the curry and add salt to taste (about ½ tsp). Serve hot with rice or bread for dipping!"
