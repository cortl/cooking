    "Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Prepare a large baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil and then placing one or two wire racks on top to hold the bacon above the surface of the baking sheet.",
    "Lay the strips of bacon across the wire rack so they are close, but not overlapping. ",
    "Bake the bacon in the fully preheated oven, for 20-25 minutes*, or until it has reached your desired level of crispiness. Begin checking the bacon at 15 minutes, as ovens can vary.",
    "After baking, use tongs to remove the strips of bacon from the wire rack to a paper towel lined plate. Serve immediately.",
    "Allow the remaining bacon grease to cool for about ten minutes, then pour off into a bowl or jar, and reserve for another use."
