    "For the Chicken: Place 1 chicken breast in a resealable plastic bag or between two pieces of plastic wrap. Using a meat pounder, rolling pin, or small skillet, pound chicken breast into an even thickness, about 3/4 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining 3 breasts.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk fish sauce, water, soy sauce, honey, salt, and pepper together. Add chicken breasts and turn to coat evenly. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 12 hours.",
    "For a Charcoal Grill: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.",
    "For a Gas Grill: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.",
    "Remove chicken from brine, letting excess drip off (do not pat dry), then brush with oil as needed until evenly coated. Clean and oil the cooking grate. Place chicken, skin side down, on grill and cook (over coals if using charcoal or covered if using gas) until chicken develops dark grill marks, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip, and continue to cook until chicken registers 155℉ (68℃, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and tent with aluminum foil while preparing the salad.",
    "For the Salad: Transfer 2 tablespoons of the prepared Caesar dressing to a small bowl and whisk with 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil. Brush bread with remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil and grill (over coals if using charcoal), uncovered, until browned on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a serving platter or individual plates and rub all over with the garlic clove and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. ",
    "Brush the cut sides of romaine halves with reserved oil and dressing mixture; place half of romaine, cut side down, on grill (over coals if using charcoal). Grill, uncovered, until lightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to the platter or plates with the bread. Repeat with the remaining romaine heart halves. Grill the lemons cut side down until lightly charred, about 1 minute and transfer to the platter or plates. ",
    "Slice the chicken thin and arrange with the grilled romaine. Drizzle the romaine and chicken with the remaining dressing. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Serve with the grilled lemon halves for squeezing over the salad."
