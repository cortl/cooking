        "For the Filling:",
        "8 ounces light brown sugar (1 cup, packed; 225g)",
        "2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
        "3/4 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt (see note); for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight",
        "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger",
        "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg",
        "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves",
        "4 1/4 pounds tart apples (about 8 large apples; 1.9kg), such as Granny Smith (see note)",
        "1 ounce tapioca starch (1/4 cup, spooned; 25g), such as Bob's Red Mill",
        "Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough, rolled and chilled per directions for a double crust",
        "For the Egg Wash:",
        "1 large egg",
        "1 large egg yolk",
        "1/2 ounce heavy cream (1 tablespoon; 15g)",
        "1/8 teaspoon (0.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight"

  "instructions": [
    "For the Filling: Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a gallon-sized zip-top bag (do not add tapioca at this time). Peel, quarter, and core the apples, then slice into 1/2-inch wedges; significant deviation can change the consistency of the filling.",
    "Measure 50 ounces sliced apples (11 rounded cups; 1.45kg) into the bag, seal tightly, and tumble until roughly coated. Macerate at room temperature, flipping the bag occasionally to distribute the syrup, until the apples have lost a third of their volume, at least 3 hours. The apples can be held up to 8 hours in the fridge.",
    "Add tapioca starch to the apples, reseal, and toss to combine. Pour apple filling into the prepared pie shell, nestling the slices into a flattish mound. Stand top crust a few seconds at room temperature until pliable, then drape on top. Pinch to seal both crusts together and trim to 3/4 inch. Tuck the dough under itself, so the pie looks something like a bonnet, or crimp into loose waves (the crust will not hold a tightly crimped design). Refrigerate the pie until cold and firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (200°C).",
    "For the Egg Wash: Whisk egg, yolk, cream, and salt together in a small bowl, then brush over the chilled pie. With a sharp knife, cut six 3-inch vents around the top, wiggling the blade left and right to open each into a wide vent.",
    "To Bake: Place pie on a parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pan and bake until 195°F (91°C) in the very center, about 75 minutes. This is easiest to monitor with an in-oven digital thermometer, which can be programmed to chime on reaching the target temperature.",
    "To Serve: Cool at least 1 hour at room temperature before serving. Wrapped in foil, leftovers will keep 3 days at room temperature. Warm in a 350°F (180°C) oven to restore the crispy crust and saucy filling."
