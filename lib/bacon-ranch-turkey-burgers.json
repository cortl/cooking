        "8 slices bacon",
        "1 lb. ground turkey",
        "3 Tbsp ranch seasoning mix*",
        "1 Tbsp cooking oil",
        "4 slices cheese (optional)",

  "instructions": [
    "Cook the bacon using the directions on the package or the method of your choice (skillet, oven, microwave) until brown and crispy.",
    "Add the ground turkey to a bowl along with the ranch seasoning mix. Using your hands, mix the ranch seasoning into the ground turkey. ",
    "Divide the ground turkey into four equal amounts, then shape into burger patties. The meat will contract quite a bit as it cooks, so make the patties quite wide and flat (about 4.5 inches in diameter).",
    "Add a little cooking oil to a skillet and heat over medium. Once the skillet is hot, add the burger patties and cook for 3-5 minutes on each side or until the burgers are browned and cooked through.",
    "If using cheese, add a slice of cheese to each burger, place a lid on the skillet and allow the heat to melt the cheese.",
    "While the burgers are cooking, slice the tomato. Build the burgers using the buns, tomatoes, lettuce, cooked bacon, and mayonnaise. Enjoy!"
