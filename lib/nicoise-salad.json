    "Quarter the baby potatoes and toss them in the olive oil spice blend.",

    "Bring 4 cups of water to a rolling boil in a medium pot or large saucepan.",
    "Remove any stems from green beens. Blanch the green beans by tossing them into the boiling water and then turning off the heat. Allow them to sit in the hot water for a very brief period of time, about 3 minutes, until they are bright green. Quickly, transfer them to an ice bath to stop them from cooking any further. Set aside.",

    "Strain the canned tuna and break it apart with a fork.",
    "Toss all ingredients together and lightly dress your salad. Finish with a crank of freshly ground pepper and sea salt."
