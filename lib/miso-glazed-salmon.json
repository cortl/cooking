      "Whisk together miso, sake, soy sauce, oil, and sugar. Rub mixture over every surface of salmon fillets. Transfer to a plastic zipper lock bag or sealable container. Proceed immediately to next step, or for best results, marinate for about 30 minutes or up to 2 days.",
      "Preheat a broiler (toaster oven or regular oven) to high. Cover a small broiler pan with aluminum foil. Rub excess marinade off of salmon and place on broiler pan. Broil until top surface is well charred and salmon is barely warm in the center, about 5 minutes, using the foil to protect any areas that threaten to burn. Serve immediately."
