  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Next wash the zucchini well, trim off the stem, then using the large holes on a box grater, grate the zucchini and set it to the side. You’ll need roughly 2 cups of grated zucchini.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, white sugar, brown sugar, applesauce, oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.",
    "Add the grated zucchini to the bowl and stir until well combined.",
    "Now in a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon until combined.",
    "Pour the flour mixture into the bowl of wet ingredients and stir them together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix at this point.",
    "Add the chopped walnuts to the bowl and gently fold them into the batter until just combined.",
    "Grease a 8.5\"x4.5\" loaf pan with butter, then add the batter evenly into the pan.",
    "Bake the zucchini bread in the preheated oven for 60 minutes or until it's deeply golden brown on top, has a crack down the center, and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean (crumbs are okay, but wet batter is not).",
    "Allow the loaf to cool for about 5 minutes in the pan, then gently remove it from the pan and allow it to finish cooling on a wire rack. Once cooled, slice, serve, and enjoy!"

  "notes": [
    "*If you have extra-large zucchini you may need to squeeze out a little bit of the excess water after it’s grated. Extremely large zucchini tend to have an even higher water content than medium-large sized zucchini."
