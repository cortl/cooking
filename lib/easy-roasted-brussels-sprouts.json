  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Wash the Brussels sprouts and trim off any dry ends. Cut each Brussels sprout in half.",
    "Place the cut Brussels sprouts on a parchment lined baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Toss until the Brussels sprouts are well coated oil and seasoning. Turn each Brussels sprout so that it is cut side facing down.",
    "Roast the Brussels sprouts in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until they are browned and caramelized on the edges. You can stir the Brussels sprouts at about 20 minutes to gauge the amount of browning on the bottom layer of the sprouts. No need to make sure they're all face down again for the final few minutes. ",
    "Taste one Brussels sprout and adjust the salt or pepper to your liking, then serve hot."
