        "1/2 cup warm/hot water",

        "rounded tablespoon corn starch",
        "1 tablespoon sesame oil",

        "1 pound flank or skirt steak, thinly sliced against grain",
        "4 cups small broccoli florets (about 1 head",
        "1 1/2 cups jasmine or white rice",
        "1 chopped green onion",
        "1â€“2 tablespoons canola/vegetable",

  "instructions": [
    "Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl starting with the water and sugar first. Whisk to combine. Set aside. Sauce can be made ahead and stored in the fridge.",
    "Thinly slice flank steak into 1/4 inch thick strips against the grain. This part is very important for tenderness. Cut strips into 2-inch bite-sized pieces.",
    "Cook rice according to the directions on the package.",
    "Meanwhile, bring skillet to medium heat. Add 1/2 cup water and broccoli. Cook broccoli, tossing occasionally until just starting to tenderize, about 5 minutes. The water helps steam the broccoli and prevents burning. If the water evaporates, add a splash more. Broccoli should not be raw but still a little snappy.",
    "Transfer broccoli to a bowl and add oil to the skillet. Add steak in a single layer and season liberally with pepper. Cook for about 1-2 minutes per side or until no longer pink.",
    "Add sauce to the skillet and bring to a simmer. As soon as it bubbles, reduce heat to low and let thicken, about 1-2 minutes. Add broccoli and toss with the steak until everything is coated. if sauce gets too thick add a little warm water. Top with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve over white rice."
