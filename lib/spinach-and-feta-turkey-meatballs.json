    "Preheat the oven to 425ºF.",
    "Roughly Chop the spinach. Heat a large skillet over medium, then add 1 Tbsp olive oil. Add the chopped spinach and a pinch of salt. Sauté the spinach until it has fully wilted, then remove it from the heat.",
    "While the spinach is sautéing, stir together the breadcrumbs, garlic powder, freshly cracked pepper (5 or 6 cranks of a pepper mill), and salt in a large bowl. Lightly whisk the egg, then add the egg, ground turkey, sautéed spinach, and crumbled feta to the bowl with the breadcrumbs. Use your hands to combine these ingredients until evenly mixed.",
    "Shape the meat mixture into balls, about one heaping tablespoon each. You should get approximately 24 meatballs.",
    "Place the meatballs on a sheet pan with about 1\" of space between them. Bake for 10 minutes, turn them, bake for another 20 minutes.",
    "Serve your cooked meatballs with your favorite sauce, over pasta, rice, or roasted vegetables."
