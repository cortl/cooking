    "ingredients": [
        "2 1/2 cups (298g) All-Purpose Flour, plus additional as needed",
        "1 teaspoon baking powder",
        "1/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1/4 cup of any one of the following: lard (57g), 4 tablespoons butter, room temperature (57g), shortening (48g), or vegetable oil (50g)",
        "7/8 to 1 cup (200g to 227g) hot tap water (about 110°F to 120°F)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.",
        "Add the lard (or butter, or shortening; if you're using vegetable oil, add it in step 3). Use your fingers or a pastry blender to work the fat into the flour until it disappears. Coating most of the flour with fat inhibits gluten formation, making the tortillas easier to roll out.",
        "Pour in the lesser amount of hot water (plus the oil, if you're using it), and stir briskly with a fork or whisk to bring the dough together into a shaggy mass. Stir in additional water as needed to bring the dough together.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead briefly, just until the dough forms a ball. If the dough is very sticky, gradually add a bit more flour."
